This project is a required test for a job interview.

NOTES:
respomse.json is saved JSON API response. The original API link and token are not made public for security reasons.

To use require() JSON file in JavaScript I used browserify's creating bundle.js function. 
In Git Bash, derictory of js file use command "browserify main.js -o mainBundle.js", and "browserify description.js -o descriptionBundle.js." 

Bundle files are included in html code instead of original js files.
